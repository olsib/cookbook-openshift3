# This section reads the config file (/etc/sysconfig/docker-storage-setup)
# Currently supported options:
#
# DEVS=
# A quoted, space-separated list of devices to be used.  This currently
# expects the devices to be unpartitioned drives.  If "VG" is not specified,
# then use of the root disk's extra space is implied.
#
# Ex. DEVS=/dev/vdb
<% if node['cookbook-openshift3']['openshift_node_docker-storage'].has_key?('DEVS') -%>
DEVS="<%= node['cookbook-openshift3']['openshift_node_docker-storage']['DEVS'].join(' ') %>"
<% end -%>
# VG=
# The volume group to use for docker storage.  Defaults to the
# volume group where the root filesystem resides.  If VG is specified and the
# volume group does not exist, it will be created (which requires that "DEVS"
# be nonempty, since we don't currently support putting a second partition on
# the root disk).
#
# Ex. VG=docker-vg
<% if node['cookbook-openshift3']['openshift_node_docker-storage'].has_key?('VG') -%>
VG="<%= node['cookbook-openshift3']['openshift_node_docker-storage']['VG'] %>"
<% end -%>
#
#
# DATA_SIZE=
# The data size can take values acceptable to "lvcreate -L" as well as some
# values acceptable to to "lvcreate -l". If user intends to pass values
# acceptable to "lvcreate -l", then only those values which contains "%"
# in syntax are acceptable.  If value does not contain "%" it is assumed
# value is suitable for "lvcreate -L".
#
# Ex. DATA_SIZE=40%FREE
